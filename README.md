Release notes
-------------

### beta-6

- Update to JavaSE 8
- Set executable permissions for the shell script launcher
- Update to use the latest PDFBox version

### beta-5

- Remove transparency before encoding jpeg images

### beta-4

- Update to use PDFBox version 2.0.16
- Fix security vulnerability

### beta-3

- Support for larger PDF documents

### beta-2

- Support for command line arguments

### beta-1

- Extracts each image object in the PDF, applies jpeg compression, and replaces the original image

- Does not check original image format. If original image format is already compressed (jpeg, jbig2, or jpeg2000), it will be recompressed as jpeg. This will always result in quality loss, but depending on the compression settings, it may *increase* file size.

Dependencies
------------

Uses [Apache PDFBox](http://pdfbox.apache.org/) to read, parse, and write PDF files (included in the pre-built app download)
